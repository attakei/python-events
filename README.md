# Python Event Maps

## Goal

This project is to **periodically** deploy website about Python events into GitHub Pages.

I am inspired by https://lmorillas.github.io/python_events/.
This is great website, but it is stopping updates since 3 year ago.

## Requirements for v0.1.0

- [ ] Fetch event data and convert for using website resources.
- [ ] Render world map with markers of current events.
- [ ] Deployment workflow with GitHub Actions.
