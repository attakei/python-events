# Python Event Maps

<kbd>![](https://github.com/attakei/python-events/blob/main/public/screenshot.png?raw=true)</kbd>

## Goal

This project is to **periodically** deploy website about Python events into GitHub Pages.

I am inspired by https://lmorillas.github.io/python_events/.
This is great website, but it is stopping updates since 3 year ago.

## Currently specs

- It displays only future events. Old event does not display.
- Geocoding does not work completely. Therefore, some events are disappeared.
- Event data are from only "Python Event Calendar". It does not fetch "User Group Calendar" yet.
